# M3SDK for Android

Welcome to the official repository for the M3SDK, an Android library designed for M3 devices. This repository contains the SDK source code and all related documentation.

## How to Read the Documents

All documentation for the M3SDK is located in the `/docs` directory. For the best experience, we recommend browsing the documents directly on the GitHub website.

### Quick Start

1.  **[Go to the Main Documentation Page](./docs/README.md)**: This page contains a complete list of all available SDK documents.

2.  **Easy Reading**: GitHub automatically renders Markdown files (`.md`) into a clean, easy-to-read format. You don't need any special software to view them.

3.  **Navigate with the Table of Contents**: When viewing a document on GitHub, you can use the table of contents icon (usually found in the top-left corner of the file view) to quickly jump to any section within the document.

## How to Get Notifications for Updates

If you want to be notified of any changes or updates to this repository, you should use the **Watch** feature.

1.  **Log in** to your GitHub account.
2.  Navigate to the main page of this repository.
3.  In the top-right corner, click the **Watch** button.
4.  Select **"All Activity"** to receive notifications for all updates.

### Watch vs. Star

*   **Watch**: Subscribes you to notifications for any activity in the repository, including code changes, new issues, and pull requests. This is the best way to stay up-to-date.
*   **Star**: Is like a bookmark. It's a way to show your appreciation and keep track of projects you find interesting, but it will not send you notifications for updates.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems while using the SDK, or if you have a feature request, please let us know by creating an issue.

1.  Go to the **[Issues tab](./issues)**.
2.  Click the **"New issue"** button.
3.  Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
    *   The device model and Android OS version.
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue.
    *   Any relevant code snippets or error logs.

This will help us resolve the problem more quickly. Alternatively, you can also reach out to us through email or other chat applications you are familiar with.
